          About Us
      </h2>
      <h4>
          As we have been learning online we have noticed that younger children find it difficult to focus during class.This leads to them not understanding concepts and finding it hard to finsh classwork, homework and assesments. We have created a website which kids can use to learn math concepts after school.This will give them time to take breaks and learn at their own pace and also recap concepts. We also noticed that many kids don't read. When we interviewed them we found out that they don't read becuase they don't know what to read.So we have also created a site for book recommendations.
